First, how has the president responded to circumstantial and uncontrollable events? For instance, how did George W. Bush respond to the attack on the World Trade Centers? Second, what initiatives have been prioritized for a given president by their own volition? For example, Barack Obama chose to prioritize healthcare reform over other policy initiatives."
